# Hands-on-ML
Fundamentals of ML

# 1. Regression

The first project consist in and end-to-end project of regression. The goal is to predict housing price based on several features.
We go trhough all the steps of a classic Machine Learning project :
  - Discovery of the Data;
  - Cleaning and Preprocessing;
  - Training and Tuning of several models;
  - Evaluation and Measures of the performances.


# 2. Classification

Similarly, we follow the same path for a classification project. This problem is based on the famous MNIST dataset. We aim to predict a digit based on its pixelized representation.
